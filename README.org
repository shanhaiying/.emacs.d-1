* Warning
- I'm using [[http://www.vim.org][Vim]] key binding. Please see "Tips" section if you prefer the Emacs key binding.
- People in Mainland China may need [[http://code.google.com/p/goagent/][goagent]] to download packages from ELPA. Run command "http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8087 emacs -nw" after starting goagent server (or any proxy server).
- C++/C developers, you need tell Emacs where to search headers to make auto-complete work. See section `clang` for details.
- I suggest Windows users using [[http://www.cygwin.com/][Cygwin]] version Emacs to avoid some overhead of setting up third party tools. But this configuration is still usable even in  native windows Emacs.
- I whitelist packages from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][melpa]] because it is too cutting edge. Modify variable "melpa-include-packages" in init-elpa.el if prefer some package from it.

* General
My first priority is -stable-. So I use fewer cutting-edge packages from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][melpa]].

Most modern popular programming languages are supported (C/C++/Java/Ruby/Perl/Python/C#/Lua/Javascript ...).

* Features
- All key binding and plugins are usable in terminal
- Real time HTML syntax checker enabled (you need install tidy)
- git or subversion is *NOT* needed. You *DONOT* need run 'git submodule update'.
- optimized for cross-platform C++ development with CMake and wxWidgets
- emacs-w3m (console browser)
- eim (Chinese pinyin input method)
- org2blog (post wordpress blog with org-mode)
- make the configuration work on *ALL* platforms (Linux/Cygwin/Mac).
- The configuration work with Emacs version >=24 but still usable with Emacs version 23 (tested with Emacs 23.4.1).
- evil-mode and its plugins (Vim key binding)
- yasnippet and my customized snippets (insert code snippet by typing less keys)

* Install
Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/master.zip][this zip file]] and extract its content into ~/.emacs.d. Ensure that the 'init.el' contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el and old -~/.emacs *IS REMOVED*.

Make sure you are connected to the internet.

you may need run the below command in the terminal at least once to update the content from package repositories:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
emacs -nw --batch -l ~/.emacs.d/init.el -f package-refresh-contents
#+END_SRC

Package repository is like Emacs App stores but all the Apps are FREE.

* Directory structure
init.el is main file which include all the other *.el files.

init-elpa define how and what packages will be installed from [[http://elpa.gnu.org][elpa]]/[[http://marmalade-repo.org][marmalade]]/[[http://melpa.milkbox.net][melpa]] by package manager.

The package manager will extract packages into ~/.emacs.d/elpa/.

I also manually download and extract some packages into ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/. Packages in ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/ is not visible to Emacs package manager.

My own snippets for [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][Yasnippet]] is in ~/.emacs.d/snippets.

Other directoris do not matter.

* Third party command line tools
These tools are *OPTIONAL*. Your Emacs will NOT crash if they are not installed.

** w3m (web browser in console) 
- needed by `w3m` (w3m is emacs package name written in elisp)
- install through OS package manager
- please note only emacs with GUI can display image

** lua
- required by `flymake-lua`
- install through OS package manager

** aspell or hunspell (RECOMMENDED), and corresponding dictionary (aspell-en, for example)
- needed by `flyspell`
- hunspell is the alternative of `aspell`. So you need only install either aspell or hunspell.
- install through OS package manager
- I force the dictionary to "en_US" in init-spelling.el. You can modify it in init-spelling.el.

** sbcl (lisp environment)
- needed by lisp `slime`
- install through OS package manager

** tidy (html tidy program)
- needed by `web-mode` for real time HTML syntax check
- install through OS package manager

** csslint
- install `node.js` through OS package manager, then `sudo npm install -g csslint`

** zip and unzip
- needed by `org-mode` to export org to odt
- install through OS package manager

** xsel
- needed by my clipboard command `copy-to-x-clipboard` and `paste-from-x-clipboard` under Linux
- install through OS package manager

** [[http://clang.llvm.org][Clang]]
- needed by `cpputils-cmake`, `flymake`, `company-clang`
- install through OS package manager
- If you use `company-clang` (default), add `(setq company-clang-arguments '("-I/example1/dir" "-I/example2/dir"))` into ~/.emacs.d/init.el
- If you use `cpputils-cmake` and `cmake`, `cpputils-cmake` will do all the set up for you.

** [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/mozrepl/][MozRepl firefox addon]]
- needed by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MozRepl][MozRepl]]
- install using firefox

** [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net][ctags]]
- needed by many tags related plugins
- install through OS package manager

** [[http://www.gnu.org/software/global][GNU Global]] 
- needed by `gtags`
- You use this tool to navigate the C/C++/Java/Objective-C code.
- install through OS package manager

** pyflakes
- You need pyflakes for real time python syntax checker like `flymake-python`
- Install pip through OS package manager, then `pip install pyflakes`
- On cygwin you need install `setuptool` in order to install `pip`.

** libreoffice
- Only one executable `soffice` needed when converting odt file into doc (Microsoft Word 97)
- conversion will happen automatically when exporting org-mode to odt
- The conversion command is in variable `org-export-odt-convert-processes`
- Install through OS package manager

* OS package manager recommended
- [[https://github.com/cfg/apt-cyg][apt-cyg]] at Cygwin
- [[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew][homebrew]] at Mac
- any package manager at Linux

* Report bug
Please file bug report at [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d]]. Don't send me email!

* Tips
By default EVIL (Vim emulation in Emacs) is used. You can comment out line containing "(require 'init-evil)" in init.el to unload it.

Some package cannot be downloaded automatically because of network problem.

You need manually `M-x list-packages` and install it or just `M-x package-refresh-content` and restart Emacs.

You can speed up the start up by NOT loading some heavy weight components like evil or yasnippet. All you need to do is add below code into ~/.bashrc:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
alias e=emacs -q --no-splash --eval="(setq light-weight-emacs t)" -l "$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el"
#+END_SRC

If you use `gnus` for email (Gmail, for example). Check ~/.emacs.d/init-gnus.el which includes my most settings except my private stuff. Here is [[http://blog.binchen.org/?p=403][my Gnus tutorial]].

To toggle Chinese input method (eim, for example), press `C-\` or run command `M-x toggle-input-method`.

* My personal custom.el (OPTIONAL)
It's publicized at [[http://blog.binchen.org/?p=430]]. It contains my personal stuff like color-theme and time locale.
